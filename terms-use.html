<h4>LOCATION OF SITES.</h4>

<p>The information provided on the Sites is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Del Monte to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Del Monte controls and operates the Sites from offices located in the United States and makes no representations or warranties that the information, products or services contained on the Sites are appropriate for use or access in other locations. Anyone using or accessing the Sites from other locations does so on his or her own initiative and is responsible for compliance with United States and local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent such local laws are applicable. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Sites and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service or other feature described or available thereon to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any such content, program, product, service or other feature that we provide.</p>

<h4>SOFTWARE.</h4>

<p>Software related to or made available by the Sites may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Sites may be downloaded, exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to the Sites, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>

<h3 id="class-action">19. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and No Class Actions</h3>

<p>We hope we never get into any disputes with you but just in case, here are some things that would apply:</p>

<h4>GOVERNING LAW/JURISDICTION.</h4>

<p>THESE TERMS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE TERMS WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES AND SPECIFICALLY WILL NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. YOU AGREE THAT JURISDICTION OVER AND VENUE IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SITES, THE USE OR ACCESS THEREOF, OR THESE TERMS MUST BE IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE COURTS LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA FOR ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING. ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES.</p>

<h4>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</h4>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action you may have in connection with or related to the Sites will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.</p>

<h3 id="terms">20. Updates to Terms</h3>

<p>Del Monte reserves the right to modify or add to these Terms or any Additional Terms, at any time without prior notice (“<strong>Updated Terms</strong>”). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Sites so that they are accessible via a link on the home page of the Sites, and that your use of the Sites after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms and any Additional Terms before using the Sites. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Sites from that point forward.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">21. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>The failure of Del Monte to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit Del Monte rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. No waiver by Del Monte of any of these Terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Del Monte. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms. Del Monte may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without any notice to you. These Terms may not be assigned by you without Del Monte’s prior written consent. If any provision of these Terms will be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Section titles are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against Del Monte by virtue of having drafted them.</p>

<p>THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ ALL THAT LEGAL LANGUAGE. NOW GO ENJOY OUR SITES!</p>
